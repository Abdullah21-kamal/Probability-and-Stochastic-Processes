# Project Description: Probability and Stochastic Processes Implementations

## This repository contains implementations for two parts of a project on Probability and Stochastic Processes, accompanied by a graphical user interface (GUI) tool. The implementations are organized into two main parts:

## Part I: Stochastic Processes Calculator
### Description:
#### Part I involves the creation of a GUI-based tool that enables users to analyze various stochastic processes, providing ensemble and time statistics. The GUI, built using MATLAB, allows users to input random processes in ensemble form and perform the following analyses:

* Plot M sample functions of the ensemble.
* Calculate and plot the ensemble mean.
* Calculate the time mean of specified sample functions.
* Calculate and plot the statistical auto-correlation function between specified samples.
* Calculate the time auto-correlation function of specified sample functions.
* Calculate and plot the power spectral density.
* Calculate the total average power of the process.
* Testing:
* The GUI is tested using the random process 


## Part II utilizes the GUI created in Part I to study binary stochastic processes. Specifically, the ACF and PSD of the following processes are analyzed:

* Polar NRZ process
* Unipolar NRZ process
* Manchester process
* Parameters:
### For each process, parameters such as amplitude, bit duration, number of bits, and initial time shift are varied.

Deliverables:
These implementations provide a comprehensive exploration of stochastic processes, enabling users to visualize and analyze their characteristics efficiently. Feel free to explore the source code and experiment with different parameters using the provided GUI.
